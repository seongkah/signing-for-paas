## Performance Insights

### Understanding Metrics

**Response Time Guidelines:**
- **< 1000ms**: Excellent performance
- **1000-2000ms**: Good performance
- **2000-5000ms**: Acceptable but could be improved
- **> 5000ms**: Poor performance, needs optimization

**Success Rate Guidelines:**
- **> 95%**: Excellent reliability
- **90-95%**: Good reliability
- **80-90%**: Acceptable but monitor closely
- **< 80%**: Poor reliability, investigate issues

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Optimize Request Timing**
   - Spread requests throughout the day
   - Avoid peak hours if possible
   - Implement request queuing

2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Validate inputs before sending requests
   - Monitor error patterns

3. **Monitor Quota Usage**
   - Track daily usage patterns
   - Set up alerts for high usage
   - Consider upgrading if consistently near limits

## Quota Management

### Understanding Your Quota
