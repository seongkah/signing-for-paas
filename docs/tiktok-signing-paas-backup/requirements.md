# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing local TikTok signing server into a cloud-hosted Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that provides public API endpoints for TikTok signature generation as a replacement for EulerStream. The service will feature a Next.js frontend hosted on Vercel for monitoring and management with a unique FQDN, Supabase Edge Functions for API backend processing, and Supabase database for authentication and data storage. This hybrid architecture will serve as a drop-in replacement for EulerStream in TikTok Live Connector projects, providing reliable, cloud-based signature generation capabilities with professional accessibility.

4. WHEN monitoring the service THEN users SHALL see signature generation statistics and system health indicators
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the dashboard SHALL display detailed error information and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3: Supabase Authentication System

**User Story:** As a service user, I want to authenticate using my email address, so that I can securely access the signing service without complex authentication flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to access the service THEN they SHALL authenticate using email-based login through Supabase Auth
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the user SHALL receive access to API endpoints and dashboard
3. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL deny access to protected resources
4. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's built-in user management capabilities
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 4: EulerStream Replacement API Architecture

**User Story:** As a TikTok Live Connector project, I want to call public API endpoints for signature generation that replace EulerStream, so that I can integrate TikTok functionality without relying on external paid services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the service SHALL provide RESTful endpoints compatible with TikTok Live Connector's signing requirements
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain the same signature generation capabilities as the local version and be compatible with EulerStream's expected format
3. WHEN handling multiple requests THEN the service SHALL support concurrent signature generation for multiple TikTok Live Connector instances
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL return responses in the format expected by TikTok Live Connector
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the API SHALL provide meaningful error codes and messages that TikTok Live Connector can handle gracefully

### Requirement 5: Database Integration and Logging

**User Story:** As a service administrator, I want to store API usage logs and user data in Supabase, so that I can track service usage and maintain audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details to Supabase database
2. WHEN storing logs THEN the system SHALL capture timestamps, user IDs, request parameters, and response data
3. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's PostgreSQL database for structured data storage
4. WHEN querying logs THEN administrators SHALL be able to filter and search historical data
5. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data retention and privacy compliance

### Requirement 6: Hybrid Architecture Scalability and Performance

**User Story:** As a TikTok Manager service, I want the signing service to handle requests efficiently using the hybrid Vercel + Supabase architecture, so that I can provide reliable service while managing costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests arrive THEN the Supabase Edge Functions SHALL process them using serverless architecture
2. WHEN users access the frontend THEN Vercel SHALL serve the Next.js application with global CDN distribution
3. WHEN under load THEN the service SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for signature generation
4. WHEN approaching free tier limits THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent rate limiting and usage monitoring
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track usage against both Vercel and Supabase free tier quotas
6. WHEN using this hybrid setup THEN the system SHALL leverage 2 million edge function invocations per month and Vercel's generous bandwidth limits

### Requirement 7: EulerStream Migration and TikTok Live Connector Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer migrating from EulerStream to this signing service, I want the cloud service to maintain full compatibility with TikTok Live Connector, so that I can replace EulerStream without changing my existing TikTok Live Connector integration code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from EulerStream THEN the API endpoints SHALL provide the same signature generation capabilities
2. WHEN processing signature requests THEN the response format SHALL be compatible with TikTok Live Connector's expectations
3. WHEN using the service THEN all existing TikTok Live Connector functionality SHALL work without modification
4. WHEN testing migration THEN the system SHALL provide tools to verify EulerStream replacement compatibility
5. WHEN switching from EulerStream THEN existing TikTok Live Connector projects SHALL work as drop-in replacements by changing only the API endpoint URL

### Requirement 8: Tiered Access Control and API Key Management

**User Story:** As a service owner, I want to implement tiered access control with API keys, so that free tier users have limited calls while API key users have unlimited access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN free tier users access API endpoints THEN they SHALL have limited daily/monthly API calls based on Supabase free tier constraints
2. WHEN API key users access endpoints THEN they SHALL have unlimited API calls for dedicated service usage
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's built-in security features within free tier limits
4. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL validate authentication tokens and API keys
5. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN free tier users SHALL receive clear messaging about usage limits and upgrade options
6. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all communications and secure environment variables
### Requirement 9: Hybrid Architecture Resource Management
